<h1>TEXT BASED ADVENTURE GAME!!!</h1>
AS of right now, I've got the game loading in the data dynamically. <br>
Next step is to be able to edit the data.<br>
Then included users.<br>
Then fix up the Game it self a bit<br>
  <ul>
  <li>as in make everything lower case once typed in</li>
  </ul>


I have to thank <a href="https://github.com/and0">Andrei</a> a shit load for what he's showing me...
